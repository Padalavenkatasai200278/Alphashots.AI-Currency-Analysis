Project Overview
The project consists of two main parts:

1.AI-Generated Stock/Indices Prediction Analysis:

A brief analysis of the machine learning algorithms used by Alphashots.AI to predict historical stock patterns.
Technical Analysis of EUR/INR Currency Data:

2.Data Scraping: Utilized Yahoo Finance to gather EUR/INR currency data from January 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.

Technical Indicators:

Moving Average (SMA)
Bollinger Bands
Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
Trading Decision: Based on the calculated indicators, decisions were made to recommend whether to BUY, SELL, or remain NEUTRAL for the specified time frames.


####### what we can do in Future  ######
In the future, I plan to implement a hybrid predictive model combining machine learning techniques, such as LSTM and Random Forest, to enhance the accuracy of currency pair predictions. Additionally, I will incorporate real-time data and sentiment analysis to continuously refine the model and adapt to market dynamics
